            <h2>DROWSINESS: The Concern</h2>
            <p>The increasing number of traffic accidents are attributed to human errors, especially drowsiness. The state of drowsiness causes people to lose their vigilance, hence becoming a danger not only to themselves, but also their surroundings. Data suggests that 30% of all traffic accidents have been caused by drowsiness.</p>

            <h2>DETECTION SOFTWARE: The solution</h2>
            <p>The software has been finally developed into a web app and at its core, makes use of Computer Vision, more specifically eye blinking detection and template matching in the OpenCV python library. As soon as the user opens this web app, he/she will have the option to start the software at will which is at the top of this page. Once the detection software is run, it records the subject’s face and simultaneously processes the frames in real time to assess the facial features. The software is extremely smart and uses an extremely important ratio called the “Eye Aspect Ratio” or EAR to make the decision of whether the subject(driver) is drowsy or not and consequently sound the alarm.</p>
